Package atecc is a driver for the Microchip ATECC608 device in Go.

It supports communication using IÂ²C and USB for dev kits.

> :warning: The API is not fully stable and may still be changed until we
> publish version 1.0.

## Availability

Cross compiling to a different platform or architecture entails disabling cgo
by default in Go. If cgo is disabled, the USB support is also disabled. For
further details, see the [usb package](https://github.com/karalabe/usb).
